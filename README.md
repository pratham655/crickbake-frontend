💡 Project Background
This project initially started as a live cricket score application using RapidAPI and Cricbuzz endpoints.
Due to API rate limits and deployment challenges, the project was re-architected into a Cricket Player Explorer powered by Wikipedia API for stable and scalable dynamic content.
The goal was to build a fully functional web app that handles real-world API challenges and deployment workflows.
